The world seems a bit grim at the moment so we thought we would try to launch a few projects which might bring some smiles to people's faces and some whimsy to the world.

Our first project is to create buttons for all the day shelters in the Gatineau park. The idea is that you can ski between shelters and collect all the buttons. If you don't get your hands on all (or any) of them, here's a photo of what they all look like.
